My Portfolio.

Welcome to my portfolio, with this readme I intend to explain a little bit about, starting with the languages, libraries and tools used to build it,  the idea or concept behind it and the structure of it.Let’s begging: 

The languages used on it were Javascript vanilla, with CSS and HTML. As far as the libraries for it I used: 
  
  Thanks to Michał Sajnóg over at  https://github.com/michalsnik/aos, This library helped me to add an animation on scroll. 
  
  Thanks to https://swiperjs.com/ : this one helped me with the slide show I used to show the projects I’ve worked on. 
  
  Thanks to @SharpTH over at Uiverse.io, Link: https://uiverse.io/detail/SharpTH/swift-bullfrog-75 not quite a library but it did help me with the styles used to
  create the button I show at the beginning with my socials and contact info. 

  Not a library but special thanks to my wife, she helped me to: Take and Edit the selfie I show at the beginning, edit the avatar I show at the end, (on that note,
  special thanks to https://www.bitmoji.com/ that is where my wife got the avatar from), and she also helped with some of the editing done to the background animation
  you see. (I will explain later how and where she helped.) 
  
The concept: I wanted to show a visually attractive website that would also portray my personality, which I believe It kind of  did, with the clear colors, and what I believe is the easy-to-use-and-understand approach I took, which is how I define my self, as a clear and easy to understand individual with a sales type approach towards life, meaning, I understand the power and the influence that looks have over products and even sometimes people. 

The Structure: 

  We begin with a background of a raining programming languages type animation, that I built myself, recorded my screen while it was playing, then it was edited so it
  would not show tabs and all that (this is where my wife helped), and then turned it into a gif and used it on a background-image CSS property.
  
  Then we have a Burger type nav-bar, since this is a one-page type website, it will not take you to any other website, it will just scroll you down to the section you
  want to see, Side note: this navbar has a few animation type effects that if you scroll over it or if you click on the actual burger you’ll get to see. All of these 
  effects were done with CSS, HTML and Javascript. 
  
  Next, we see a section with an introduction of my name and my profession, along with a real selfie, (yes that's me.!). 
  This section has a button that reads “find me on” if you hover on it you get to see my socials, if you click on any of them it will take you to my actual socials,
  options are, my linkedin, my github or my whatsapp. Thre you can also find a "Download my CV" button, that does just that, if you click it, you'll get a PDF version of my CV.
  
  Following section is an “About me” section, I thought the best way to go around this was to record a video of myself explaining a little bit about my personal and
  professional background. 
  
  Then, comes the motivation-skills, type section, that has a two paragraphs text and an animation with programming languages. The text, is intended to explain why I  
  changing careers to programming and what I find exciting about it. 
  And the animation, to also showcase my abilities and the languages I’m familiar with, I created this animation while working on the background’s animation, this is
  what the original idea for the background looked like but then saw it on the website and did not like it too much causing me to work on the raining-type-animation
  but since I liked this one I kept it.
  
  Up next we have a section with the most relevant projects I’ve worked on, with a slideshow showing a brief explanation of each one. Anyone who wants to, has three
  ways to look at the final product by clicking on the title of the project, the picture of it or by copying and pasting the link on their browser. 

  At the end, you see a cartoon type avatar of myself indicating that was the end of it and inviting people to come back.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope it was useful to understand the mindset behind my portfolio.
